# Landing Page Clone Experiment

An experiment to see how well Claude (Anthropic's AI) can replicate an existing landing page design from a single URL prompt.

## What is this?

I gave [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) the URL of [released.so](https://www.released.so/) and asked it to recreate the website focusing on the design patterns, layout, and visual style. This is the result - a single HTML file with all CSS and JS inline.

## What Claude built

- Sticky navigation with scroll-aware color transitions
- Purple gradient hero with grid overlay and animated text
- Social proof logo bar
- Product hub section with 3 portal cards (gradient headers, tags, update footers)
- "Try it yourself" embed options section
- Customer feedback section with two overlapping, tilted mockup cards (feedback list + detail view)
- Tailored Roadmaps with Gantt-style bars
- AI-generated release notes section with animated rainbow gradient border
- Zendesk integration diagram
- Testimonials grid (3x2 cards)
- Security & trust section on dark background
- Full footer with 5-column link grid and massive brand wordmark
- Scroll-triggered fade-in and stagger animations throughout
